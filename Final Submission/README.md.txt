Follow the following steps to view the codes working and make any changes for future use:
View the presentation (.pptx) file in google slides or power point presentation to be able to see the animation.
**Note: In the beginning of every code, commented lines are written about the results of the code. Read Carefully**

1. The **animation.py** contains the code for the given data by the Timetooth industries and the animation is generated where we can clearly see the scrubbing points
2. The animation_corrected file  has the step height incresed by 2cm and then the animation is generated.
3. There is a **inverse_kinematic.py** file, which contains the code for calculating the joint angles from a given input set of coordinates, 
   these joint angles are then used in the animation files for different cases. 
5. Collision_points.py contains the intial collision points in the trajectory.
6. The **hip_move_animation.py** contains the code considering the movement of torso,
7. The **hip_move_animation_corrected.py** contains the considering the hip movement along with increasing the step height
8. The **No_Coll_Anim.py** consists of the final code of improved animation showing the no scrubbing motion.
9. All the files are clearly commented and refer to the Figures uploaded as a part of the submission for more clarity of the joint angles 
   that we have asssumed, the geometry applied to calculate the joint angles.
